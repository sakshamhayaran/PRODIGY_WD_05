Task 05 : Weather App

Exciting Project Completion at Prodigy InfoTech

I'm delighted to announce that I have successfully completed Task-05, building a Weather App for Prodigy Infotech!

This project involved :

• Creating a web page that fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. 

• The app displays the current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information, providing users with accurate and up-to-date weather insights.

• Utilizing HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding dynamic behaviour.

This task was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my skills in front-end development and create a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.
